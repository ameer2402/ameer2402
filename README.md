## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! My name is **Mohammed Ameerkhan**, and I’m a passionate **Full Stack Developer** from India.

My journey into web development began during my third year of college when I joined a bootcamp that sparked my curiosity in frontend development. Over time, I expanded into backend systems and databases, giving me a strong foundation in building full-stack applications.

Currently, I’m working on projects using the **MERN stack** and continuously exploring new technologies to build scalable, accessible, and impactful web applications.
